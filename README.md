# Sales Forecasting Project (2022–2026)

This project is based on forecasting yearly sales from 2022 to 2026 using Python.  
The main objective is to analyze past sales data and predict future trends to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Overview
The project includes:
- Python source code for implementing the forecasting model.
- A PowerPoint presentation explaining the approach, methods, and results.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical yearly sales data.
- Build a simple and efficient forecasting model using Python.
- Present the results visually through graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- PowerPoint (for presentation)

## Files Included
- `sales_forecasting.py` → Python source code  
- `sales_forecasting_presentation.pptx` → PowerPoint presentation file  

## How It Works
1. The code imports the dataset and cleans it for analysis.  
2. A Linear Regression model is trained using past yearly sales data.  
3. The model predicts sales for the years 2022 to 2026.  
4. The results are visualized using graphs for clear understanding.  

## Results
The project provides a simple yet effective way to visualize future sales growth based on previous years’ performance.
